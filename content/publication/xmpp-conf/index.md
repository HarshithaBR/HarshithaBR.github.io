abstract: Extensible Messaging Presence Protocol (XMPP) is a real-time information transmission specification protocol that is based on IP technology and Extensible Markup Language supporting publish/subscribe messaging systems. Multicast is the operation that is carried out by a publisher in a publisher-subscriber scenario such that it simultaneously sends data to multiple subscribers. There are many XMPP Extension Protocols (XEPs) available in the literature, that enable the use of XMPP for multicast. This network is made up of publishers who publish messages to multiple subscribers, some of whom may overlap. This is a case of Multiple Multicast (MMC). In this paper, a novel architecture to extend XMPP for multiple multicast has been proposed to cater multiple multicast in a publish subscribe network. In the literature, it was found that multiple multicast was not extensively considered in a mobile, publish subscribe network, hence the architecture proposed to cater to the multiple multicast nature for data exchange between multiple publishers to multiple groups of subscribers. In the considered network of subscribers in publish subscribe scenario, cluster heads help in forwarding the data to nodes connected to it and a cloud storage is used to ensure that message is successfully delivered to all the subscribers from publishers by creating a hierarchical structure to the network. Multilevel cache ensures that overloading does not happen at any cache memory. This paper attempts to reduce the number of replications and other overheads incurred by these replications. Performing multicast dramatically reduces network traffic by delivering a single stream to multiple receivers.
