abstract: A mathematical formula is devised to optimize latency and bandwidth, subject to constraints during message passing down the logical tree. Pseudo code and algorithms on message transmission by a publisher and various other cases, such as subscriber management and changing the cluster head, are discussed. A diverse set of example cases are presented that can use multiple multicast for XMPP-based applications. The basic version of this work was presented in INCET 2022 Conference.
